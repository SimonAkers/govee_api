# govee_api
A simple Rust crate for utilizing the Govee HTTP API.

This crate is currently a work-in-progress. Currently, all features are blocking, as I have not had the time to properly implement asynchronous calls.

Note that the Govee HTTP API is not permitted to be used in a commercial manner, and thus neither is this crate.
The intention of this crate is to allow developers to further automate their Govee smart home devices for personal use only.
By using this crate, you acknowledge that I claim no liability for the abuse, misuse, or the breaking of Govee's Terms of Service by anyone other than myself.

You can request an API key (along with a link to the API documentation) through the Govee Home mobile application.
